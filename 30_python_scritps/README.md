Python's suitability for creating both simple and complex applications has made it a highly sought-after and popular programming language in recent times. This article is for you if you are new to Python programming and want to quickly learn the fundamentals of the language. This article explains 30 examples of Python scripts using very basic examples so that you can understand the fundamentals of Python.

Without first creating a Python file, you can use the terminal to write and run a basic script. If the script is lengthy, it must be written using any editor and saved as a Python file. To write the script, you can use any text editor, any code editor (such as sublime, Visual Studio Code), or any IDE program designed specifically for Python (such as PyCharm or Spyder). The Python file has the.py extension.
